# cal for BearOS

This is a simple implementation of the old Unix 'cal' utility for BearOS. 
If a real-time clock is installed, 'cal' without arguments will display
the calendar for the current month. Otherwise you can use 'cal month year'.

The `-j` switch turns selects day-of-year rather than day-of-month
numbering.
