bc_lib
------

A library of helpful functions to make "bc" more friendly.

Angle mode
----------

angle=deg
Set angle mode to degrees

angle=rad (the default)
Set angle mode to radians

Basic functions
---------------

alog10(x)
Commaon (base-10) antilogarithm of x, that is, 10^x

acos(x)
Arccosine of x. If angle = deg then result is in degrees, else in radians

asin(x)
Arcsine of x. If angle = deg then result is in degrees, else in radians

atan(x)
Arctangent of x. If angle = deg then result is in degrees, else in radians

cos(t)
Cosine of t. If angle = deg then t is in degrees, else in radians

cosec(t)
Cosecant of t. If angle = deg then t is in degrees, else in radians

cot(t)
Cotangent of t. If angle = deg then t is in degrees, else in radians

log(x)
Natural logarithm of x

log10(x)
Commaon (base-10) logarithm of x

pyth(x,y)
Length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides x and y

sec(t)
Secant of t

sin(t)
Sine of t. If angle = deg then t is in degrees, else in radians

tan(t)
Tangent of t. If angle = deg then t is in degrees, else in radians

todeg(t)
Converts t, an angle in radians, to degrees

todeg(t)
Converts t, an angle in degrees, to radians 

Hyperbolic functions
--------------------
cosh(x)
Hyperbolic cosine of x

sinh(x)
Hyperbolic sine of x

tanh(x)
Hyperbolic tangent of x


Rounding functions
------------------
abs(x)
Absolute value of x

ceil(x)
Round x to the nearest higher integer. So floor(-4.5) is -4.

floor(x)
Round x to the nearest lower integer. So floor(-4.5) is -5.

frac(x)
Fractional part of x. Result is logical, but may be surprising, where
x is a negative number. For example, frac(-1.2) is 0.8.

gcd (x,y)
Integer greatest common divisor of x and y

int (x)
Rounds x to the integer nearest zero, like the (int) cast in C. That is,
just discard the fractional part of x.

lcm (x, y)
Integer least common multiple of x and y. That is, the smallest integer
that has both x and y as factors.

mod(x,y)
Integer remainder when x is divided by y. For the record, the result will
be negative if x is negative.

rnd (x)
Rounds x to the nearest integer, whether higher or lower. rnd(0.9) is 1,
rnd(-1.8) is -2.

sgn (x)
The sign of x. Returns 1 if x > 0, -1 of x < 0, otherwise 0.

Notes
-----
The constant "pi" can be obtained from the function "pi()", e.g.,
"sin(pi() / 2)"

There is no "e" or "e()" to get the constant that is the base of natural
logarithms, because e() is a built-in function. To get this constant,
use "e(1)"
