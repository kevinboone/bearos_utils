# Bearcal for BearOS

Bearcal is a simple, command-line expression evaluator. It is derived from a
calculator I originally wrote for CP/M. The BearOS version is much larger than
the CP/M version, with little additional functionality -- that, I guess, is the
price of progress.

A significant part of the implementation is derived from TinyExpr, by Lewis Van
Winkle.

Bearcal can be built for BearOS or Linux; the two versions are expected to
behave identically.

For instructions on using Bearcal, see bearcal.md.
