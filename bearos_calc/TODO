Generally tidy up. The implementation is a bit messy. In particular, a lot
of logic is mixed up with the display operations.

Find a way to deal with the situation where a function definition changes
while another function is still using it. At present, this generally
causes a crash, because redefining the function frees its memory.

A big job: reimplement the arithmetic in decimal, and remove the reliance
on the bloated ARM floating point math library. This is how bc works,
after all.

Separate out the processing of commands from expressions, and parse the command
properly. This would open the way to implementing more sophisticated
commands, like integration or tabulation.
