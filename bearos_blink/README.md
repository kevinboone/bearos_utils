# blink for BearOS

This is the BearOS version of the convention 'blink' utility for the Pico. It
is really a programming demonstration, rather than a funcional end-user
utility.

`blink` uses the BearOS GPIO character device to control the relevant GPIO pin,
which can be selected using the `-p` switch.
